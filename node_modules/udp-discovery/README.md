udp-discovery
=============
This module provides discovery services using UDP multicast. udp-discovery
implements the zero-configuration UDP multicast discovery and works only between
nodes on the same subnet as typically, broadcast packets don't route.

# Installation

    npm install udp-discovery

# Example

## Application sending advertisements

```JavaScript
var Discovery = require('udp-discovery').Discovery;
var discover = new Discovery();

var name = 'test';
var interval = 500;
var available = true;

var serv = {
  port: 80,
  proto: 'tcp',
  addrFamily: 'IPv4',
  bonus: {
    name: 'Edmond',
    day: 2233,
    week: [ 'monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday' ]
  }
};

discover.announce(name, serv, interval, available);

discover.on('MessageBus', function(event, data) {
  console.log('event:',event);
  console.log('data:',data);
});
```

## Application receiving advertisements

```JavaScript
var Discovery = require('udp-discovery').Discovery;
var discover = new Discovery();

discover.on('available', function(name, data, reason) {
  console.log('available ',name);
  console.log('data',data);
  console.log('reason',reason);
  var obj = {a: 1, b: '2', c: true, d: {e: 333}};
  discover.sendEvent('Hello', obj);

  console.log(name,':','available:',reason);
  console.log(data);
});

discover.on('unavailable', function(name, data, reason) {
  console.log(name,':','unavailable:',reason);
  console.log(data);
});
```

# Discovery constructor

## new Discovery([options])

Invokes the constructor to create an instance of Discovery to receive discovery
events.  The config options object is optional, but if included, the following
options are available:

* **Number** `port` - The port to listen upon for service announcements. Default:
  44201.
* **String** `bindAddr` - The address to bind to. Default: listens to all
  interfaces.
* **String** `dgramType` - Either 'udp4' or 'udp6'. Default: 'udp4'.

# Discovery methods

## announce(name, userData, \[,interval\] \[,available\])
Starts announcing the service at the specified interval. The parameter,
`serviceObject`, is an object describing the service that udp-discoveryy
announces.

* **String** `name` The name of the service being announced. It must be unique, or
  it will collide with another.
* **Number** `interval` The duration between announcements in milliseconds.
* **Any** `userData` Any data that can be serialized into JSON.
* **Boolean** `available` Optional parameter to set availability of the service.
  If not specified, the default is 'true', meaning available.

Any property with a default can be left out and the code supplies the default
value. The name and data are required.

## pause(name)
- **String** `name` The name of the service.
- *Returns* true if successful, false otherwise.

Halts announcements.

## resume(name, \[,interval\])
- **String** `name` name of the service.
- **Number** [`interval`] optional interval between announcements in ms.
- *Returns* true if successful, false otherwise.

Resumes the announcements at the time interval.

## getData(name)
- **String** `name` name of the service.
- *Returns* **Object** serviceObject from announce.

*Returns* the service object, which can be modified. For example, if you need to
alter the `userData`, you can. You cannot, however, alter the name (it's a
constant property).

## update(name, userData \[,interval\] \[,available\])
Updates the existing service.

* **String** `name` The name of the service being announced. It must be unique, or
  it will collide with another.
* **Any** `userData` Any data that can be serialized into JSON.
* **Number** [`interval`] Optional duration between announcements in milliseconds.
* **Boolean** [`available`] Optional parameter to set availability of the service.
  If not specified, the default is 'true', meaning available.

# Discovery Events

## 'available'
Has the following parameters:

- **String** `name` name of the service.
- **Object** `data` user-defined object describing the service.
- **String** `reason` why this event was sent: 'new', 'availabilityChange',
  'timedOut'.

This event can happen when:

- The first announcement for a service is received.
- The availability changes, if the available status changes from false to true.

## 'unavailable'
Has the following parameters:

- **String** `name` name of the service.
- **Object** `data` user-defined object describing the service.
- **String** `reason` why this event was sent: 'new', 'availabilityChange',
  'timedOut'.

This event can happen when:

- The first announcement for a service is received and the service is
  unavailable..
- The availability changes, if the available status changes from true to false.
- When 2x the announce interval time for the service elapsed without an
  announcement being seen. The service is considered unavailable and removed
  from the list of services.
