This is a NodeJS client for Duneplayer and EMBY.  To install, clone the repository and type "npm install" in the directory.  The paths in the file "DUNEInterface.js" in the node_modules folder may need to be edited based on the file setup.  To start the program execute "node index.js".  The program will launch an http interface which is available on "localhost:3000".  From here you can edit your IP addresses, passwords, etc.  When you are finished, press the "Start Controller" button to get things rolling.  This only needs to be done once (or whenever passwords/server IPs change).
